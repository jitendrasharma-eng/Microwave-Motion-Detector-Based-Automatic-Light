# Microwave-Motion-Detector-Based-Automatic-Light
This project is an automatic light control system using a microwave motion detector. When motion is detected, the system automatically turns on a connected light and keeps it ON for a defined period. It is a touchless, energy-saving solution for smart lighting applications.
